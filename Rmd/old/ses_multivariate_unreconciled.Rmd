# Introduction

All analyses were performed with reference gene normalized data. In addition, we estimated and applied the optimal Yeo-Johnson power transformations to each gene, in order to bring each gene's distribution as close as possible to Gaussian.

# Two multivariate analyses.

Results of two linear multivariate models, treating each disease gene set as a vector. All models include the usual controls.

The p-values for parametric multivariate linear analyses derive from a Mancova style type II decomposition of the model errors, as implemented in the car::Mancova function. FDR corrections for multiplicity via Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. 

The permutation p-values for the same linear multivariate model result for permuting the focal variable - say "ses_sss_composite" - in the model's design matrix then estimating the Pillai statistic via the same procedure (car::Manova). This was repeated $N= 1000$ times creating a histogram encoding of the null distribution: i.e. the distribution of Pillai, were ses_sss_composite scores unrelated to the outcome vector. The p-value is calculated in the standard way as the fraction of the 1000 samples that were equal to, or larger than, the observed Pillai (with unpermuted predictor ses_sss_composite). Beware: pending permutations with larger $N$, some p-values were exactly 0, i.e. the observed Pillai was larger than any permutation value. In this case multiple correction is inaccurate. 

# One Univariate analysis

In lieu of treating the outcome as multivariate, we then took the median of the normalized expression values for each gene set as a scalar outcome variable. We performed standard univariate linear regression of this outcome on the same controls and treatments as above. The raw and FDR-corrected p-values for these analyses are given in each table below. 

# Notes for Wenjia

I used the median, not the mean and also applied Yeo-Johnson transforms to the univariate signatures. These, and other variations can be altered if they differ from your analysis.
