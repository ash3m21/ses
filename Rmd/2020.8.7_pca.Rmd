# P-values from MANCOVA on top 9 components (m6) and the corresponding uncorrected p-values component-wise.

A note on notation: 

nn = no rotation,
vx = varimax,
ob = oblimin (oblique).

So: m6_ob is the Mancova p-value for the top 9 dimensions of oblique rotated. Collumn m7_ob_d3 is, for example, the p-value associated with dimension 3 of that outcome vector.


For ease of scanning, the second table is simply a thresholded version of the first. 1 means the uncorrected p-value is < 0.05. 0 means otherwise.

ex[1] %>%
