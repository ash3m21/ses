# Like a right fold, a left fold cannot perform magic and go to the end of the
# list instantly; it must start from the beginning of the list. However, the
# parentheses dictate how our code evaluates. The type of the argument to the
# folding function changes in addition to the associativity:

# The fundamental way to think about evaluation in Haskell is as substitution.
# When we use a right fold on a list with the function ùëì and start value ùëß,
# we‚Äôre, in a sense, replacing the cons constructors - in R, these are the
# commas - with our folding function and the empty list constructor with our
# start value z

# a la Haskell
